# Cloud-and-React-based-Social-Network
* Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GKE) for better scaling
* Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)
* Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model and integrate with the Go service.
